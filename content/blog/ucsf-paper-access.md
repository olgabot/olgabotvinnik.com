If you’ve had issues with accessing paper PDFs at UCSF or CZ Biohub, this is my solution (summarized from https://www.library.ucsf.edu/use/access/):

1. Get a UCSF email account by requesting UCSF affiliation: https://hr.ucsf.edu/hr.php/x/files?F=1&cms_id=1012
2. Add “Reload via EZ Proxy” to your bookmarks bar - link: void((function()%7Blocation.href%3D%27https://ucsf.idm.oclc.org/login%3Fqurl%3D%27%20%2B%20encodeURIComponent(location.href)%3B%7D)())%3B
3. Go to a closed-access paper website
4. Hit “Reload via EZ Proxy” in the bookmarks bar and enjoy your PDF!

The EZ Proxy is used across many campuses and may apply to yours as well.
