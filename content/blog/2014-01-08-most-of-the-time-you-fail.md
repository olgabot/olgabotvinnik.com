This year, I only applied to two fellowships: [Hertz](http://www.hertzfoundation.org/) and [Paul and Daisy Soros](http://www.pdsoros.org/). And I didn't even get to the interview stage of either of them. But I'm gonna keep on trucking. After all, it's [grit and determination that lead to success](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/ted-talks-education/speaker/dr-angela-lee-duckworth/). So I'll have a lot more failures before I get to the success, but that's okay.
