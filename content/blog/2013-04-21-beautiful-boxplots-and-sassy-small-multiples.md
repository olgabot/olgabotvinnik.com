Last week, I [posted](http://blog.olgabotvinnik.com/post/47682463203/implementing-graphic-design-principles-in-pythons) about implementing design principles in Python's graphic library, matplotlib. I received lots of great feedback, and made another tutorial, specifically about boxplots and [_"small multiples"_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_multiple). Small multiples are a concept coined by Edward Tufte about having many plots using the exact same axes, allowing the reader to discover patterns by eye, though here I also add linear regression to aid the eye.
